# Contributing Guide

Contributing is a pretty straight forward process.

If you want to contribute, then make your changes, test it using the
[container-security-action-demo](https://github.com/drewbernetes/container-security-action-demo) and then raise a pull
request.

That's pretty much all there is to it.
